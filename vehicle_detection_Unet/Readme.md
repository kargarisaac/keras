# Vehicle detection using image segmentation
In this project, We used annotated vehicle data set provided by Udacity: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations. Then I trained a scaled down version of U-Net architecture. The input to U-net is a resized 960X640 3-channel RGB image and output is 960X640 1-channel mask of predictions.
There are some useful links which I used:
