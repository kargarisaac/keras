# SegNet
SegNet is deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation. Introduced spsampling layer in the SegNet paper there is not in keras. I used a completely sequential model without any skip connection in my architecture. 
I trained the model on my laptop for 1400 epochs and batch_size = 5 on CamVid dataset. You can see some of the results in notebook.
